# MyMultiplayerOnlineGameProject
An on-going third-person multiplayer online game featuring farming, grinding, leveling, PvP capture zones, and puzzle elements. Play across diverse worlds and themed rifts with four unique classes. As a self-taught junior indie developer, Iâ€™ve been building this project since April 2025, focusing on replication and optimization.
